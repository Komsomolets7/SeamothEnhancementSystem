 Seamoth Enhancement System

 Heartfelt personal welcome from
 Professor Mimes Pes, Chief Scientific Officer

 Dear Alterra Employees

 As you may know, Alterra staff members have been working hard and presented you over the years with many wonderful inventions to help you in hours of your greatest need. These improvements are collectively named "Mods". I have also been actively involved in R&D of Alterra survival kits available to you in case of unexpected planetary (crash) landing. I am very pleased to offer you a truly "team effort" mod, which can be added, should you wish, to your survival kit arsenal on your Alterra voyages.  This mod is in its last "beta" stage, you may consider it a "final open beta".

 Presenting "Seamoth Enhancement System" mod

 What does this mod do?

 This mod enables you to add 3 groups of modules to your trusty Seamoth, linked by a computer chip:

 Advanced "Heads Up Display" (HUD) computer chip link add on to activate enhancements

 Electrical Enhancements:
 Lo & Hi beam Headlights
 Advanced "in-cabin" battery management

 Electronic Enhancements:
 Turbo and Green Modes
 Cruise Control
 Improved Health, Power and Temperature HUD reporting

 Mechanical Enhancements:
 Gears
 Speedometer

 With no Seamoth link chip inserted into player chip slot, all modules, if present, are not activated and HUD icons are grey.

 How to use this mod?

 Player will acquire main the functionality of this mod by building Vehicle Upgrade Console in your Moonpool. When Upgrade Console is activated, in addition to Seamoth, Exo-suit, Common and Torpedo icons, there is an additional icon called "Vehicle piloting enhancements". When entered, it displays available enhancement modules crafting:

 Electrical module
 Electronic module
 Mechanical module
 Seamoth link

 The first three modules are Seamoth modules and are designed to be inserted into Seamoth upgrade slots. Seamoth link is a chip to be inserted into a player chip slot, which enables Advanced Heads Up Display link between player HUD and Seamoth enhancements providing their full control and functionality.

 In addition to that, Modification station allows for a creation of a single "Seamoth enhancement system" module, which combines functionality of Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical modules.

 Seamoth enhancement system mod is fully customisable:

 In Subnautica main screen click on "Options".
 Click on "Mods" button.

 +-----------------------------+----------------+
 | Wiring kit                   | 1  |
 +-----------------------------+----------------+

 Functions:

 Lo & Hi Beam Headlights:

 Lo beam headlights are very useful for scouting and collecting raw materials as the light beam is wide and intensity is ideal for close illumination reducing &/or eliminating strong reflections which make visibility challenging. High beam is much more focused, stronger and with a great reach, enabling good situational awareness during high speeds.

 +-----------------------------+-------------------+----------------+

 +-----------------------------+------------ ------+----------------+

 Advanced battery management:

 Allows battery exchange from the safety of the Seamoth cabin by pressing "R" key.

 +----------------------------------------+----------------+
 | Advanced wiring kit              | 1  |
 +----------------------------------------+----------------+

 Functions:

 Turbo and Green engine modes:

 Turbo mode offers great speed at an expense of relatively high energy consumption. With Mechanical module present, it allows gear changes from 1 to 6.
 Green mode offers slightly slower but energy efficient engine performance. With Mechanical module present, it allows gear changes from 1 to 6.

 Cruise Control:

 Allows forward movement without holding the "W" or forward key.

 Functions:

 Gears:

 Gears allows player to limit Seamoth max speed to a predetermined value as per table below. For example, ow speeds are useful for scouting for ores and other resources, docking into Moonpool and Cyclops, and during manoeuvring through difficult areas such as cave entrances. High speeds are indeed necessary to escape predators or simply material collecting make expeditions from bases more time efficient.
